        Policy and strategy advising
      </h3>
      <p>
      Policy briefs and strategy memos are essential tools for making informed decisions in complex, high-stakes environments. A <strong>policy brief</strong> is a concise, evidence-based document that presents a specific issue, explains why it matters, and offers actionable recommendations for decision-makers. These are used by public agencies, NGOs, and private sector leaders who need to quickly understand the landscape and move forward with confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
      A <strong>strategy brief</strong> takes that a step further—it doesn’t just explain a problem, it lays out a roadmap. Strategy briefs synthesize research, stakeholder priorities, and anticipated risks into a plan of action. These documents are especially valuable when organizations face uncertainty or must allocate limited resources toward competing goals.

      <p>
      The value of these briefs lies in clarity. Busy decision-makers don’t have time to wade through a 60-page report. They need sharp analysis, presented with urgency and precision. That’s where Inkwell Global Report comes in. With a background in medicine, public health, and data science, we craft briefs that are not only accurate but deeply strategic—grounded in real-world constraints and responsive to the people they’re meant to serve.

      <p>
      If you need to advocate for a program, justify a funding request, or communicate risk to stakeholders, a well-crafted brief can make the difference between being heard and being overlooked. We specialize in bridging technical insight and policy relevance—turning complexity into clarity.
