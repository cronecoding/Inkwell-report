        <h2>Rebecca Kimble, MD, MPH</h2>
        <h3>Research / AI Engineering Lead</h3>

        <div class="profile-content">
          <p>
            Originally from the United States and now based in Germany, I bring a global, cross-disciplinary perspective to my work as Research Lead and AI Engineer at <em>Inkwell Global Report</em>. My career has spanned emergency medicine, public health, environmental sustainability, and data science—shaped by hands-on experience in diverse settings across the U.S., Africa, and Europe.
          </p>

          <p>
            I began as a board-certified emergency physician (MD), providing frontline care in fast-paced and high-stakes environments. Over time, I shifted my focus to public health, earning a Master of Public Health (MPH) and contributing to initiatives that address climate resilience, humanitarian assistance, and global health logistics. I’ve led evaluations, designed data-informed strategies, and supported programs that operate in complex and often resource-limited contexts.
          </p>

          <p> 
            More recently, I’ve expanded into data analytics and artificial intelligence, applying tools like Python, SQL, and generative AI to explore trends, visualize ideas, and uncover new insights. <em>Inkwell Global Report</em> is the culmination of these experiences—a consulting platform that merges rigorous research with creative technologies to help people and organizations navigate the world’s most pressing questions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m passionate about using data to tell stories that matter, and I believe in the power of collaboration to drive positive change. I’ve worked with a range of organizations, from nonprofits to government agencies, and I’m committed to fostering partnerships that amplify impact. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I hold a Doctor of Medicine (MD) from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Yeshiva University and a Master of Public Health (MPH) from Brown University. I’m also a board-certified emergency physician and a member of the American Public Health Association. I have multiple IBM certifications in data science and AI, including Python for Data Science, Data Science Fundamentals, and AI Engineering. I’m fluent in English and have basic written and verbal German and French skills.
